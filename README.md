# Toronto-Traffic-Collisions

This project analyzes Toronto collision data and Census demographic data (both sources from Open Data toronto), with the main goal to uncover patterns—across neighborhoods, times, and traffic modes—to support road safety improvements city-wide. Data were initially cleaned and prepared using MS Excel, with final data prepation in Python. A correlation matrix was generated to show correlations between several key variables (such as density and various types of collision rates), and then regresion analyses were done specifically for collision rate per capita.
